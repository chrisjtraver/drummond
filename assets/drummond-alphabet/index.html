<div>Hello my name is Drummond</div>
<div>One Love One Heart
Lets get together and feel all right
Hear the children cryin
Hear the children cryin
Sayin give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right
Sayin lets get together and feel all right

Let them all pass all their dirty remarks
There is one question Id really love to ask
Is there a place for the hopeless sinner
Who has hurt all mankind just to save his own beliefs

One Love What about the one heart One Heart
What about Lets get together and feel all right
As it was in the beginning
So shall it be in the end 
All right
Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right
Lets get together and feel all right
One more thing

Lets get together to fight this Holy Armageddon
So when the Man comes there will be no no doom
Have pity on those whose chances grows thinner
There aint no hiding place from the Father of Creation
